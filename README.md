# SlippyPeak

This is a super simple mod that just makes you slip every ~7 seconds when you have less than 10% of your stamina left.

It will not affect climbing, only when you are on the ground. This makes it more important to keep an eye on your stamina- you don't want to slip when you reach the top!
