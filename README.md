# SlippyPeak

## Thunderstore Link: https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/rushork_games/SlippyPeak/

## Description:
- A simple mod I've made to try out modding in C# on my self-development day from work.
- Makes you slip once you reach < 10% stamina. Does not affect you whilst climbing (so lunging to reach the top/etc is unaffected).
- Uses a similar logic to banana peels for the slipping.
